<<add-actor Stage scarab>>
<<left-actor Stage scarab>>
<<set-primary Stage scarab>>

Scarab: Very wise words, Caravaneer.

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: Don't flatter me. I've been called many things, most of them true, and wise is not one of them. But let's get down to business.
Caravaneer: If you want to learn to push the sun, you're going to need to read this book.

He hands you "The Book of the Dead". The bookstore owner comes over to you.

<<set-primary Stage ghost>>
Hyperactive Ghost: GREAT choice for a book. Not many people who come through here want that book anymore. Lost their faith in magic, that's what I say! But, unfortunately, that's a PRISTINE copy of the book. Well, fortunate AND unfortunate. 
Hyperactive Ghost: Fortunate because it's excellent, unfortunate because IT COSTS A TON!! So, let's talk-

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>
Caravaneer: How about this. I'll cut you a deal! You give me that book, and I don't tell my bosses what you're doing here. Sounds good?

<<set-primary Stage ghost>>

Hyperactive Ghost: . . . . . . . . . . . . . take it

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: Gotta say, a big perk of eternal imprisonment is that everyone wets their pants at the thought of being put in a similar situation to me. Gives me a lot of leverage.

<<set-primary Stage scarab>>

Scarab: You are imprisoned?

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: No, I eternally run this caravan because I love the work. Of course I'm imprisoned. I really only still exist because of Qamaar's influence. Some days, I curse her for it. This job… it grinds a person down.
Caravaneer: On the worst days, I can't even remember why I exist. I just know I have to keep existing… keep working…

Caravaneer: Most days, though, I get through it. I used to believe that if I put in the work for penance, there was a chance I could be forgiven. But now, I know I'll never be free of this punishment.
Caravaneer: Maybe one day, people will look at me working and decide the world has been made right... but I'm not sure if I'll make it to that day.
Caravaneer: But enough about me. Read that book, and find me again.

He runs out the door, leaving you and Scarab in the lotus shop.

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: I feel like… you're upset about the sun.
<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

Protestor Ghost: Are you serious?? YES I'm upset about the sun! We're ALL upset about the sun.

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: I'm confused, though.

<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

Protestor Ghost: We believe your punishment was far too light to befit your crime. We're about justice, and we're making the world right!

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: Ohhhh, I get it. You want to make the world right.

<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

Protestor Ghost: Obviously!

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: So this protest will bring the sun back?

<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

Protestor Ghost: Well, of course not. But we can give the sun the justice she deserves.

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: Ohhhhhhh. So you don't know how to bring the sun back?

<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

Protestor Ghost: Obviously-

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: Well I do know how to bring the sun back.

<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

Protestor Ghost: Right! And tha's what-

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: I'm the only one left who knows how. And do you know what would happen if I died?

<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

Protestor Ghost: Justice would be served.

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: Maybe! But I know one thing for certain. No one. Not a soul. Would ever be able to move the sun again. So while you're bitching, I'm making sure my knowledge lives on. So that one day, the world can be made right. So don't tell me about justice.

<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

Protestor Ghost: How DARE you talk to me like that!! You! A criminal! I didn't want to resort to this, but you give me no choice!

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: What are you going to do? Hit me? I'm immortal. As long as I have to serve, death can't release me.

<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

Protestor Ghost: A shame your magic was taken away. You used to be formidable. You're chained to serve? How about I break those chains.

<<set-primary Stage caravaneer>>

Caravaneer: You'll halt the entire underground!

<<set-primary Stage protestor-ghost>>

<<set-primary Stage priest>>

Priest: I sense the energy of Qamaar's temple on you. This temple here is dingy by comparison.

<<set-primary Stage scarab>>

Scarab: I know you cannot see, but this temple is actually much nicer than Qamaar's.

<<set-primary Stage priest>>

Priest: In quality of stone, perhaps. But a temple's grandiosity is brought by the power and faith of those who reside in it. Qamaar provides an ocean of power, and it floods her temple. But the Bazaar is a place of travel and movement, and our magic is only supplied by those who pass through here. People like you. And people like him.
